            <h1>origin of cricket</h1> 
            
            <h2>1800s to 1918</h2>
            <p>India became a member of the 'elite club' joining Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand and the West Indies in June 1932. India's first match in Lord's against England attracted a massive crowd of 24,000 people as well as the King of the United Kingdom.The major and defining event in the history of Indian cricket during this period was the Partition of India following full independence from the British Raj in 1947.</p>

            <h2>1918 to 1945</h2>
            <p>An early casualty of change was the Bombay Quadrangular tournament, which had been a focal point of Indian cricket for over 50 years. The new India had no place for teams based on ethnic origin. As a result, the Ranji Trophy came into its own as the national championship. The last Bombay Pentangular, as it had become, was won by the Hindus in 1945–46.</p>

            <h2>1945 to 1960</h2>
            <p>India also recorded its first Test victory in 1952, beating England by an innings in Madras
            One team totally dominated Indian cricket in the 1960s. As part of 14 consecutive victories in the Ranji Trophy from 1958–59 to 1972–73, Bombay won the title in all ten seasons of the period under review. Among its players were Farokh Engineer, Dilip Sardesai, Bapu Nadkarni, Ramakant Desai, Baloo Gupte, Ashok Mankad and Ajit Wadekar.</p>
